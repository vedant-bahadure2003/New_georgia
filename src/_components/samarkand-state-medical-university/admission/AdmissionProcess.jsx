          How to Take Admission in Samarkand State Medical University?

        <p className="mt-2 text-[14px] text-justify md:text-[16px] text-black">
          MBBS admission at Samarkand State Medical University operates through
          an uncomplicated application path. Prospective students need to fill
          out the online application form found on the university website, which
          requires document uploads. The administrative staff of the university
          reviews your application before issuing an admission decision within
          48 hours.
          <br /> <br />
          Your application for a visa depends on two requirements: payment of
          the initial first-year classes and verification of valid passport
          status. The visa application process requires 30 days before visa
          approval is obtained to allow students to book their next trip. You
          must present your documents at the universityâ€™s admission office to
          finish your enrollment process.
